# Making A Game: Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a set of workshop files for writing (parts of) a JS + `<canvas>` Tic-Tac-Toe game.

The workshop is organized into multiple steps:

-   Step 1: drawing the grid lines
-   Step 2: drawing the X's and O's
-   Step 3: detecting and showing a win or tie
-   Step 4: adding a computer player
-   Final: final solution
