# The Beginners Guide to React.js

### Goal of Course

To help developers with React and to learn to fundamentals of it. Start with no React and slowly start adding React into the course. Gain an understanding of what the `React.createElement()` API is and that a `JSX` is a simple abstraction on top of it and what `Babel` does to our `JSX` to make it work like regular JavaScript.

The course will look into common APIs all the way through `state`, the `component lifecycle hooks` building and using form elements, why React requires a `key` prompt when you render an array of elements, and how to make an `HTTP REQUEST` with React.
