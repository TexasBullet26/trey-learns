# Creating Your App

---

Welcome to the Ember Tutorial! This tutorial is meant to introduce basic Ember concepts while creating a professional looking application. If you get stuck at any point during the tutorial, feel free to download [https://github.com/ember-learn/super-rentals](https://github.com/ember-learn/super-rentals) for a working example of the completed app.

You can install the latest version of `Ember CLI` by following the [Quick Start](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/getting-started/quick-start/#toc_install-ember) guide "Installing Ember" section.

Ember CLI, Ember's command line interface, provides a standard project structure, a set of development tools, and an addon system. This allows Ember developers to focus on building apps rather than building the support structures that make them run. From your command line, a quick `ember --help` shows the commands Ember CLI provides. For more information on a specific command, type `ember help <command-name>`.

## Creating a New App

To create a new project using Ember CLI, use the `new` command. In preparation for the tutorial in the next section, you can make an app called `super-rentals`:

`ember new super-rentals`

A new project will be created inside your current directory. You can now go to your `super-rentals` project directory and start working on it:

`cd super-rentals`

## Directory Structure

The `new` command generates a project structure with the following files and directories:

```
|--app
|--config
|--node_modules
|--public
|--tests
|--vendor

<other files>

ember-cli-build.js
package.json
README.md
testem.js
```

Let's take a look at the folders and files Ember CLI generates:

**app**: This is where folders and files for models, components, routes, templates and styles are stored. The majority of your coding on an Ember project happens in this folder.

**config**: The config directory contains the `environment.js` where you can configure settings for your app.

**node_modules / package.json**: This directory and file are from npm. npm is the package manager for Node.js. Ember is built with Node and uses a variety of Node.js modules for operation. The `package.json` file maintains the list of current npm dependencies for the app. Any Ember CLI addons you install will also show up here. Packages listed in `package.json` are installed in the node_modules directory.

**public**: This directory contains assets such as images and fonts.

**vendor**: This directory is where front-end dependencies (such as JavaScript or CSS) that are not managed by npm go.

**tests / testem.js**: Automated tests for our app go in the `tests` folder, and Ember CLI's test runner **Testem** is configured in `testem.js`.

**ember-cli-build.js**: This file describes how Ember CLI should build our app.

## Modules

If you take a look at `app/router.js`, you'll notice some syntax that may be unfamiliar to you:

```js
import EmberRouter from '@ember/routing/router';
import config from './config/environment';

const Router = EmberRouter.extend({
    location: config.locationType,
    rootURL: config.rootURL,
});

Router.map(function() {});

export default Router;
```

Ember CLI uses ECMAScript 2015 (ES2015 for short or popularly known as ES6) modules to organize application code. For example, the line `import EmberRouter from '@ember/routing/router';` gives us access to Ember's Router class as the variable `EmberRouter`. And the `import config from './config/environment';` line gives us access to our app's configuration data as the variable `config`. `const` is a way to declare a read-only variable to make sure it is not accidentally reassigned elsewhere. At the end of the file, `export default Router;` makes the `Router` variable defined in this file available to other parts of the app.
