# Routes and Templates

---

For Super Rentals, we want to arrive at a home page which displays a list of rentals. From there, we should be able to visit an about page and out contact page.

## An About Route

Let's start by building our "about" page.

In Ember, when we want to make a new page that can be visited using a URL, we need to generate a "route" using Ember CLI. For a quick overview of how Ember structures things, see [our diagram on the Core Concepts page](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/getting-started/core-concepts/).

Let's use Ember's route generator to start our `about` route:

`ember generate route about`

_Note: Running `ember help generate` will list a number of other Ember resources you can create as well..._

And here's what our generator prints out:

```
installing route
  create app/routes/about.js
  create app/templates/about.hbs
updating router
  add route about
installing route-test
  create tests/unit/routes/about-test.js
```

An Ember route is built with three parts:

1. An entry in the Ember router (`/app/router.js`), which maps between our route name and a specific URI

2. A route handler file, which sets up what should happen when that route is loaded (`app/routes/about.js`)

3. A route template, which is where we display the actual content for the page (`app/templates/about.hbs`)

If we open `/app/router.js`, we'll see a new line of code for the **about** route, calling `this.route('about')` in the `Router.map` function. That new line of code tells the Ember router to run our `app/routes/about.js` file when a visitor navigates to `/about`.

_app/router.js:_

```js
import EmberRouter from '@ember/routing/router';
import config from './config/environment';

const Router = EmberRouter.extend({
    location: config.locationType,
    rootURL: config.rootURL,
});

Router.map(function() {
    this.route('about');
});

export default Router;
```

Because we only plan to display static content on our about page, we won't adjust the `/app/routes/about.js` route handler file right now. Instead, let's open our `app/templates/about.hbs` template file and add some info about Super Rentals:

```hbs
<div class="jumbo">
    <div class="right tomster></div>
    <h2>About Super Rentals</h2>
    <p>
      The Super Rentals website is a delightful project created to explore Ember.
      By building a property rental site, we can simultaneously imagine traveling
      AND building Ember applications.
    </p>
</div>
```

Now run `ember serve` (or `ember server`, or even `ember s` for short) on your command line to start the Ember development server and then go to http://localhost:4200/about to see our new page in action!
