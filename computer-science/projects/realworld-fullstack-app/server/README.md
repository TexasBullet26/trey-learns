# Real-World Fullstack App (Server)

---

We are using Node as an API. To do this, we set up [Express](https://expressjs.com/) for server logic and will be using MongoDB for the database (which is a popular choice in the Node community, as MongoDB [stores data in the JSON format](https://www.mongodb.com/json-and-bson))

This `server` directory is where we build the backend in Node.js. Once the backend is completed, we can complete any frontend provided to create a client for the backend we've built.

## Prerequisites

---

### Environment Setup

---

**Install Node**

- via [Node's main website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- via [most package managers](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/)

**[Install MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/)**

### Project Setup

---

**Review the [API documentation](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld/blob/master/api/README.md)**

**Clone the seed project**

To clone the seed branch of [this repo](https://github.com/gothinkster/node-express-realworld-example-app), run the following command:

`git clone -b 00-seed git@github.com:gothinkster/node-express-realworld-example-app.git`

**Run `npm install` to install all the required modules for our project**

The seed repository has all the modules required for this project denoted in its `package.json`. You can use [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (which should've automatically been installed with Node) to install all of the necessary modules locally.
