# Trey Learns

This is a repository to keep track of anything that I'm learning or have learned. This includes notes on tutorials, books, docs, or anything.

## Purpose

To have a backed-up centralized location for any and all notes that I take and want to share, somewhat like a journal. This is not limited to the scope of any one subject.
